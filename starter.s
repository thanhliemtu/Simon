    # TODO: Before we deal with the LEDs, we need to generate a random
    # sequence of numbers that we will use to indicate the button/LED
    # to light up. For example, we can have 0 for UP, 1 for DOWN, 2 for
    # LEFT, and 3 for RIGHT. Store the sequence in memory. We provided 
    # a declaration above that you can use if you want.
    # HINT: Use the rand function provided to generate each number

   
    # TODO: Now read the sequence and replay it on the LEDs. You will
    # need to use the delay function to ensure that the LEDs light up 
    # slowly. In general, for each number in the sequence you should:
    # 1. Figure out the corresponding LED location and colour
    # 2. Light up the appropriate LED (with the colour)
    # 2. Wait for a short delay (e.g. 500 ms)
    # 3. Turn off the LED (i.e. set it to black)
    # 4. Wait for a short delay (e.g. 1000 ms) before repeating
    
    
    # TODO: Read through the sequence again and check for user input
    # using pollDpad. For each number in the sequence, check the d-pad
    # input and compare it against the sequence. If the input does not
    # match, display some indication of error on the LEDs and exit. 
    # Otherwise, keep checking the rest of the sequence and display 
    # some indication of success once you reach the end.


    # TODO: Ask if the user wishes to play again and either loop back to
    # start a new round or terminate, based on their input.
